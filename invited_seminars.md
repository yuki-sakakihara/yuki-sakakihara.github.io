  - Abstract:  The observational data suggest that the universe experienced an era of explosive expansion in its earliest time, called inflation, and is also currently expanding at an accelerated rate. In order to explain these exotic behaviors, a scalar field whose classical condensate drives the expansion is often introduced in cosmology. In the language of effective field theory (EFT), the leading-order models of such a scalar field are so-called k-essence (or k-inflation) and have been widely considered in cosmological contexts. However, the dynamics of k-essence models generically runs into a classical singularity called caustics. Such a singularity is an indication of the breakdown of the EFT (= k-essence). We propose a mechanism in which the singularity is resolved by entering into the regime of more fundamental UV theory, where the EFT is no longer valid. We also demonstrate that all the k-essence models as an EFT need to meet non-trivial conditions in order to be consistent with such UV completions. Our consideration is independent of whether the Lorentz symmetry is broken by the background or not.

  - Title: **Field-theoretic simulations of topological defects in cosmology** [[pdf]](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1b-CG3Lw4wlg-c3g_juiOKCJILupN-3lR?usp=sharing)
  - Abstract: The topological defects associated with the spontaneous symmetry breaking play a crucial role to prove the extremely early Universe as well as to provide a clue to high-energy physics such as the grand unified theories. We briefly review the basic properties of the topological defects and their role in the cosmological context, and introduce our past studies on them employing numerical simulations based on the classical field theory in 3D computational box.
